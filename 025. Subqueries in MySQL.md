MySQL queries can get pretty complex at times.

When we write queries inside other queries, then they are called "SUB" queries. It is something similar to "nested" loops in programming.

A SUB QUERY is a query nested inside other query such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE.

The query that contains another query is called the "outer" query whereas the other is called the "inner" query.

For example, let's suppose we have two tables - "employees" and "offices". We want to list all the employees who work in the offices that are located in the USA. In this case, we need to compare the work location of an employee with all the USA office locations. And these two are present in two different tables. 

Here, we can use a SubQuery.

    SELECT 
        lastName, firstName
    FROM
        employees
    WHERE
        officeCode IN (SELECT 
                officeCode
            FROM
                offices
            WHERE
                country = 'USA');

So, in the above query, we have the "OUTER" query which is a simple "SELECT" statement that retrieves the last_name and first_name columns from the employees table. 

Then, we have an "INNER" query which is another "SELECT" statement that retrieves all the officeCodes of the offices that are located in the "USA".

Let's take another example.

Let's say we have an "employees" table where we have the "hourly_pay" of every employee. Now, we want to list the first_name, last_name, hourly_pay and also the average of all the hourly_pay values.

In this case, we again need to use a Subquery because to get the average of all the hourly_pay values, we need a separate query.

So, the query will look like - 

    SELECT 
        first_name, 
        last_name, 
        hourly_pay, 
        (SELECT AVG(hourly_pay) FROM employees) AS avg_pay
    FROM employees;

Let's take another example. Let's say we want to find the employees having hourly_pay greater than the average_hourly_pay.

    SELECT 
            first_name, 
            last_name, 
            hourly_pay
    FROM employees
    WHERE hourly_pay > (SELECT AVG(hourly_pay) FROM employees)

Again, we had to use a subquery here for the WHERE clause to get the average of hourly_pay in the employees table.

Let's take another example. We have two tables - customers and transactions. We want to list all the customers who have made at least one transaction. In other words, all those customers whose customer_id is present in the transactions table. So, we can write -

    SELECT * FROM customers
    WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM transactions);

Now, you will think that since customer_id is present in both the tables, why not use an INNER JOIN instead? Well, you are not wrong. There are some cases when we can use both the subqueries as well as the joins. 

Subqueries and JOINs can both be used in a complex query to select data from multiple tables, but they do so in different ways. Sometimes you have a choice of either, but there are cases in which a subquery is the only real option.

The good thing in sub-queries is that they are more readable than JOINs: that's why most new SQL people prefer them; it is the easy way; but when it comes to performance, JOINS are better in most cases even though they are not hard to read too.
