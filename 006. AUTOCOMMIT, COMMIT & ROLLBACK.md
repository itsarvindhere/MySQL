By default, MySQL starts the session for each new connection with autocommit enabled, so MySQL does a commit after each SQL statement if that statement did not return an error. 

This means, that by default, as you execute statements, they will be COMMITTED automatically. Sometimes, this is not the behavior we want. Because, let's say we run a "DELETE FROM employees" statement accidentally without the "WHERE" clause. In that case, the whole table will become empty and the data will be removed. And since AUTOCOMMIT is enabled, that statement will be COMMITTED automatically by MySQL. This means, we will not be able to ROLLBACK.

So, if we want a fine control over COMMIT and ROLLBACK, we should turn the AUTOCOMMIT function off. We do that by writing -

    SET autocommit = 0;

Now, let's say we are going to write a DELETE query. Now, before that we can execute - 

    COMMIT

What this will do is, this will create sort of a SAVEPOINT to where we can return if anything goes wrong with the statements that we are going to execute next.

For example, now, if we execute - 

    DELETE FROM employees;

This will remove all the rows from the "employees" table. This might be a mistake so now, we want to go back to the savepoint that we had created.

For that, we simply need to execute -
    
    ROLLBACK

And now, if we fetch the data, we will see that all the data is there in the table which was present before executing the DELETE statement.

That's how we use the COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements.
