One of the most common tasks in MySQL is "searching". For example, from an employee table, we need to get the records of only those employees for which job level is "4". In that case, MySQL will need to scan the entire table to search all the employees that match the search criteria. While this may not be a big deal for small tables, when it comes to massive tables with thousands of records, the search process is pretty time consuming.

To make it faster, we can use "INDEXES" in MySQL.

Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values quickly. Without an index, MySQL must begin with the first row and then read through the entire table to find the relevant rows. The larger the table, the more this costs. 

If the table has an index for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly determine the position to seek to in the middle of the data file without having to look at all the data. This is much faster than reading every row sequentially.

Indexes are less important for queries on small tables, or big tables where report queries process most or all of the rows. When a query needs to access most of the rows, reading sequentially is faster than working through an index. Sequential reads minimize disk seeks, even if not all the rows are needed for the query.

While searching is faster when we use INDEXES, the Updating the data is slower. So, there are pros and cons of using INDEXES. 

INSERTs are always slower with indexes because the database now has to write them into the table as well as into all indexes. The more indexes you have, the slower it becomes. So it's up to you to balance out performance on SELECTs and INSERTs.

DELETEs can be sped up as the database finds the relevant data faster, but are also slowed down as it's now removing the data from the table as well as all indexes. You also have to check if it makes sense on your particular table. Generally, very selective DELETES (i.e. only a small amount of rows from a large table) are going to benefit from an index, but large DELETEs won't.

UPDATEs combine both, so the same things apply.

So, when you want to decide whether to use Indexes in a table, think of whether this table will be updated frequently or not. For example, if there is a Transactions table with millions of rows of data, it will be updated very frequently and so, having an INDEX on this table is not of much use.

On the other hand, if we have a table for the employees, then it is a good candidate to use INDEXES on because we will be searching very frequently in this table, even though it might not get updated very frequently.

# THE PHONE BOOK ANALOGY

Suppose you have a phone book that contains all the names and phone numbers of people in a city.

Let’s say you want to find Bob Cat’s phone number. Knowing that the names are alphabetically ordered, you first look for the page where the last name is Cat, then you look for Bob and his phone number.

If the names in the phone book were not sorted alphabetically, you would need to go through all the pages, reading every name on it until you find Bob Cat.

This is called sequential searching. You go over all the entries until you find the person with the phone number that you are looking for.

Relating the phone book to the table, if you have the table phonebooks and you need to find the phone number of Bob Cat, you would perform the following query:

    SELECT
        phone_number
    FROM 
        phonebooks
    WHERE 
        first_name = 'Bob' AND 
        last_name = 'Cat';

It is pretty easy. Although the query is fast, the database has to scan all the rows of the table until it finds the row. If the table has millions of rows, without an index, the data retrieval would take a lot of time to return the result.

# THE CLUSTURED INDEX

When you create a table with a primary key or unique key, MySQL automatically creates a special index named PRIMARY. This index is called the clustered index.

The PRIMARY index is special because the index itself is stored together with the data in the same table. The clustered index enforces the order of rows in the table.

Other indexes other than the PRIMARY index are called secondary indexes or non-clustered indexes.

# VIEWING ALL THE INDEXES OF A TABLE

To show the current indexes of a table, we can use the following query - 

    SHOW INDEXES FROM "table_name";

For example, for the customers table, we can write - 

    SHOW INDEXES FROM customers;

One interesting thing you will notice is that the customers table already has an INDEX on the "customer_id" column, which is also the PRIMARY KEY of this table. This means, by default, the fastest way to search in a table is through its PRIMARY KEY column.

# APPLYING AN INDEX TO COLUMN(S) OF A NEW TABLE

While creating a new Table, we can create indexes at the same time. The syntax is -

    CREATE TABLE "table_name" (
        "column_name" "data_type",
        "column_name" "data_type",
        ...............
        INDEX("comma-separated column names")
    );

# APPLYING AN INDEX TO COLUMN(S) OF EXISTING TABLE

Let's say we frequently search the customers through their last_name columns. So, a good option would be to apply an index on this column.

To apply an Index to a column, use the following syntax - 

    CREATE INDEX "index_name"
    ON "table_name"("column_name")

For example, to create an index on the "last_name" column, we can write - 

    CREATE INDEX last_name_index
    ON customers(last_name)

And now, a new INDEX has been created on the last_name column.

# MULTI-COLUMN INDEXES

In MySQL, we can create "COMPOSITE" indexes which means indexes comprised of more than one columns. An index may comprise of up to 16 columns.

The query optimizer uses the composite indexes for queries that test all columns in the index, or queries that test the first columns, the first two columns, and so on.

If you specify the columns in the right order in the index definition, a single composite index can speed up these kinds of queries on the same table.

If we want to create a composite / multi-column index at the time of table creation, the syntax is -

    CREATE TABLE table_name (
        c1 data_type PRIMARY KEY,
        c2 data_type,
        c3 data_type,
        c4 data_type,
        INDEX index_name (c2,c3,c4)
    );

If the table already existsm we can use the "CREATE INDEX" statement to create a new composite / multi-column index. The syntax is - 

    CREATE INDEX index_name 
    ON table_name(c2,c3,c4);

# THE ORDER MATTERS IN COMPOSITE INDEXES

You should create composite / multi-column indexes very carefully because the order in which you will write the column names will define how efficient the search will be.

For example, if you have a composite index on (c1,c2,c3), you will have indexed search capabilities on one of the following column combinations:

    (c1)
    (c1,c2)
    (c1,c2,c3)

MySQL has something known as a "leftmost prefix" with indexes.

For example, if the composite index is defined on (c1,c2,c3), then MySQL cannot use this index if the query is like - 

    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        table_name
    WHERE
        c1 = v1 AND 
        c3 = v3;

Because (c1,c3) is not a valid combination for the composite index defined on (c1,c2,c3).

That's why the order matters. You need to think of how you are going to search through the table and based on that, you should then decide on how to define your multi-column indexes.

Let's understand this by another example. Let's say we created a multi-column index on first_name and last_name indexes -

    CREATE INDEX last_first_index
    ON customers(last_name, first_name)

Note that here, we have written last_name and then first_name. This means, the valid combinations when this index will be used are - 

    (last_name)
    (last_name, first_name)

So, if we search for customers by their last_name, then this composite index will be utilized. For example if the query is like - 

    SELECT * FROM customers
    WHERE last_name LIKE "%s"

Similarly, if we search for customers by their last_name AND their first_name, then also this composite index will be used because (last_name, first_name) is a valid combination. For example, the following query will work - 

    SELECT * FROM customers
    WHERE last_name LIKE "%s" AND first_name LIKE "a%"

But, if we first search by the "first_name" and then by the "last_name" then the composite index will not work because the combination (first_name, last_name) is not a valid combination for the composite index that we have created.

SO, the following query will not use the composite index - 

    SELECT * FROM customers
    WHERE first_name LIKE "a%" AND last_name LIKE "%s"
