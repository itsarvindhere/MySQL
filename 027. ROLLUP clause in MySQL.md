The ROLLUP clause is an extension of the GROUP BY clause.

The ROLLUP clause will produce another row and shows the GRAND TOTAL. 

The syntax is - 

    SELECT 
    "comma_separated_columns"
    FROM 
        "table_name"
    GROUP BY
        "comma_separated_columns" WITH ROLLUP;

For example, if we have a "transactions" table and we want to know for each day, how many transactions were made, we can use a GROUP BY as - 

    SELECT order_date, COUNT(amount)
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY order_date

Now, let's say we also want to see what is the TOTAL number of transactions made so far.

In that case, we can use the 'ROLLUP' clause along with GROUP BY

    SELECT order_date, COUNT(amount)
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY order_date WITH ROLLUP

And now, the result set will have a new row at the end, which will have the total number of transactions.

# USING ROLLUP WITH MULTIPLE GROUP BY COLUMNS

We know that we can have multiple columns in GROUP BY clause, depending on how many non-aggregated columns we have in SELECT statement.

Now, if we use the "ROLLUP" clause in such a GROUP BY statement, then something interesting happens.

For example, in our "transactions" table, we want to see how many orders each customer made every day. But, along with that, we also want to see how many total orders are being made each day. 

This means, for each group, we also want a subtotal. And that's where a ROLLUP clause is super helpful.

We can say -

    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(transaction_id) as no_of_transactions,order_date
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY order_date,customer_id WITH ROLLUP

Now, it is very important that you take care of the order in whcih you write the column names in GROUP BY clause. If you have more than one column specified in the GROUP BY clause, the ROLLUP clause assumes a hierarchy among the input columns.

For example, we have written - 

    GROUP BY order_date, customer_id WITH ROLLUP

In this case, ROLLUP clause assumes that there is a hierarchy as 

    order_date > customer_id

And so, it will generate the following grouping sets - 

    (order_date, customer_id)
    (order_date)
    ()

So, 

    GROUP BY order_date, customer_id WITH ROLLUP

The above line means that ROLLUP clause will generate a new row every time the "order_date" changes. This means, after every group ends, there will be a new row below it that has the count of transactions made that day.

Now, if we had - 

    GROUP BY customer_id, order_date WITH ROLLUP

Then, the hierarchy would be like -

    customer_id > order_date

In other words, whenever the customer_id changes, a new row will be added by ROLLUP clause with the total number of transactions for that customer_id for that particular day.

So, based on your requirement, you might want to change the order.

For example, if you want the individual transactions of each customer grouped by the day and then you also want the total number of transactions per day, you will need to write customer_id before the order_date in the GROUP BY clause.

But, if you want the transactions from multiple customers each day and then you also want total number of transactions each day, you will need to write order_date before the customer_id in the GROUP BY clause.

No matter how you write the order, at the end of the result-set, there will always be an additional row that has the GRAND TOTAL.
