In MySQL, we can JOIN two tables based on some common column in both. But, it is also possible to JOIN two tables, where both are the same table. When we do that, it is called a "SELF JOIN". It helps in displaying a heirarchy of data.

It is better understandable by an example.

Let's say that we have a customers table where apart from the "first_name", "last_name", we also have a column named "referral_id". This is the id of another customer who referred this customer.

So now, we are asked to list all those customers, who have been referred by some other customer. And we are also asked to display the names of both the customer as well as the customer who referred.

So here, we need to display a heirarchy of data so we will use a Self Join here. 

When using Self Joins, just imagine the two tables as the two circles of the VENN DIAGARM. Don't think of them as the same tables. Think of them as two different tables that we are trying to join. 

So, the table on the left is our "customers" table from where we just need the first and last name of the "customers". The table on the right is also the "customers" table but from this, we need the first and last name of those customers who referred other customers.

# SELF JOIN USING INNER JOIN

We will use the same syntax as for INNER JOIN. So, the query becomes -

    SELECT A.customer_id, 
    CONCAT(A.first_name, " ", A.last_name) AS customer_name, 
    CONCAT(B.first_name, " ", B.last_name) AS referred_by 
    FROM customers AS A
    INNER JOIN customers AS B
    ON A.referral_id = B.customer_id

In the above query, "A" is the table on the left and "B" is the table on the right. And we are joining the two tables by the fact that the referral_id in left table is present as a customer_id in the right table. 

# SELF JOIN USING LEFT JOIN

If we also need to display the customers that were not referred by any other customer, it means that we need to show all the records from the table on the left. In other words, we require a "LEFT JOIN" in that case.

    SELECT A.customer_id, 
    CONCAT(A.first_name, " ", A.last_name) AS customer_name, 
    CONCAT(B.first_name, " ", B.last_name) AS referred_by 
    FROM customers AS A
    LEFT JOIN customers AS B
    ON A.referral_id = B.customer_id

# SELF JOIN USING RIGHT JOIN

Similarly, we can use the RIGHT JOIN to join two same tables based on the requirement. For example if we want to list all the customers, doesn't matter if they referred anyone or not, then it simply means we need to display all the records from the table on the right. In other words, we need a RIGHT JOIN here.

    SELECT A.customer_id, 
    CONCAT(A.first_name, " ", A.last_name) AS customer_name, 
    CONCAT(B.first_name, " ", B.last_name) AS referred_by 
    FROM customers AS A
    RIGHT JOIN customers AS B
    ON A.referral_id = B.customer_id

# ALIAS IS IMPORTANT IN SELF JOIN

Since we are joining two same tables, it is very important that you give an ALIAS to each of the tables otherwise MySQL will show an error because MySQL will otherwise consider both the tables are the same. But, we want to treat the same table as two different tables when joining.

Similarly, when we refer to any column_name, we need to be specific about which table's column name we are referring two since both tables will have the same column_names.
