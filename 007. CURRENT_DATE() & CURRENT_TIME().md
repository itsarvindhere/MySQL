Sometimes we have to deal with date and time values in our tables. 

For example, let's say we have a table in which we have to keep track of the "Date", "Time" and also the "DateTime" (which is simply DATE AND TIME together).

For that, we have some built-in methods that we can use to get the current date, the current time and the current timestamp.

Let's say we have a table "test" created as - 

    CREATE TABLE test (
        my_date DATE,
        my_time TIME,
        my_datetime DATETIME
    );

So, it has three columns. The "my_date" column is of type "DATE", the "my_time" column is of type "TIME" and the column "my_datetime" is of type "DATETIME".

Now, let's say we want to insert a new ROW with the current date, time and datetime values. For that, we can use the built-in methods. We can do -

    INSERT INTO test
    VALUES (CURRENT_DATE(), CURRENT_TIME(), NOW());

The method "CURRENT_DATE()" gives the current date, for example -> "2023-12-27".

The method "CURRENT_TIME()" gives the current time, for example -> "16:08:20".

Finally, the method "NOW()" gives the datetime, for example -> '2023-12-27 16:08:20'.

If you want to add or subtract days from the DATE, we can simply use the addition and subtraction operators.

For example, if we do -

    INSERT INTO test
    VALUES (CURRENT_DATE() + 1, CURRENT_TIME(), NOW());

This new row will have the tomorrow's date in the first column.

Similarly, if we do - 

    INSERT INTO test
    VALUES (CURRENT_DATE() - 1, CURRENT_TIME(), NOW());

This new row will have the yesterday's date in the first column.

The same thing can be done with the TIME. We can add or remove "seconds" from the TIME value.
