In MySQL, Wildcard Characters are used to substitute one or more characters in a string. They are used with the "LIKE" operator. The "LIKE" operator is used in a "WHERE" clause to search for a specific pattern in a column.

In MySQL, there are two wildcard characters. These are - 

    1. % -> It represents zero or more characters
    2. _ -> It represents a single character

For example, bl% means all the values that start with "bl" and have zero or more characters afterwards. For example, "bl", "bla", "black", "blue" etc are all matching values.

Similarly, h_t means all the values that start with "h", end with "t" and have any character in between. So, "hit", "hot", "hat" will all match.

Let's say in the "employees" table, we want to look for all the employees whose first name starts with an "s". In that case, we can use the wildcard characters. We will use them with a "LIKE" operator.

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE first_name LIKE "s%"

Similarly, if we want to find the employees whose last_name ends with an "r" , we can say - 

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE last_name LIKE "%r"

And this searching is not limited to only the strings. Instead, we can also apply it to other types, such as DATE.

For example, if in the "employees" table, we want to fetch the data of all the employees whose hire_date is in 2023, we can say -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE hire_date LIKE "2023%"

We can use the underscore (_) at any place where we want one random character. For example, if we want to search for all the employees whose jobs start with some random character, followed by "ook", we can say -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE job LIKE "_ook"

Here, an underscore means that in its place, there can be any one character. If we had "%ook" then it would've meant that there can be zero or more characters before "ook". So, "ook", "book", "brook", "asdsaasdasook" etc will all match in case of "%ook".

And we can use "_" more than once. For example, we want to find a name that starts with some character, has "abc" in between and then ends with some character. In that case, we can say -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE first_name LIKE "_abc_"

For example, we want to find all the employees for which the hire_date is in January. It doesn't matter what Year or What day it was, but the month needs to be january. So, we can say -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE hire_date LIKE "____-01-__"

We can also combine the two wildcard characters.

For example, we want to find jobs where the second character is an "a". So, we can write - 

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE job LIKE "_a%"
