The "UNIQUE" constraint ensures that a column does not have same values for multiple rows.

A good example of this is the "employee_id" column in the "employees" table.

It is not possible for two different employees to have the same employee_id value. But without the "UNIQUE" constraint, we can still insert a new row which has the same employee_id value as some existing row.

To add a UNIQUE constraint to a column while creating a Table, we can do -

    CREATE TABLE "table_name" (
            "column1_name" "datatype" UNIQUE,
            "column2_name" "datatype" UNIQUE,
            .....
    )

Multiple columns in a table can have the UNIQUE constraint.

For an existing table, if we want to add the "UNIQUE" constraint for any column(s), we can use the "ALTER TABLE" statement along with the "MODIFY COLUMN" statement.

    ALTER TABLE employees
    MODIFY COLUMN employee_id INT UNIQUE

Another way is to use the "ADD CONSTRAINT" statement along with the "ALTER TABLE" statement.

    ALTER TABLE employees
    ADD CONSTRAINT
    UNIQUE(employee_id)

Note that inside UNIQUE(), we can pass a comma separated names of columns to which we want to add the UNIQUE constraint.

So now, the employee_id column has the "UNIQUE" constraint. Now, if we try to enter a new row which has the employee_id same as some existing row - 

    INSERT INTO employees
    VALUES (5, 'TEST', 'TEST', 24.50, "2023-01-08");

Now, we will get an error and the query will not execute. That's because a row already exists which has employee_id set to "5". And since the "employee_id" column has a "UNIQUE" constraint, it means no two rows can have the same employee_id value.
