So far, we have created a Table and also learned how we can work with Columns in a Table. We know how to Create a new column, Drop an existing table, Rename a table, move the column around and so on.

The next step is to learn how to Insert Data into the Table. In other words, Inserting Rows in a table.

# ADDING A NEW ROW

To Insert a new Row, we can use the "INSERT" statement. The syntax is - 

    INSERT INTO "table_name"
    VALUES ("comma-separated values");

For example, if we have a table "employees" with fields -> employee_id, first_name, last_name, hourly_pay and hire_date, then this is how we will insert a row in this table - 

    INSERT INTO employees
    VALUES (1, "Eugene", "Krabs", 25.50, "2023-01-02");

It is important to note that when we enter the values for a row, the order matters. The order in which you enter the data should be the same as the order of the columns in the table.

For example, in "employees" table, this is the order in which the columns currently are -> employee_id, first_name, last_name, hourly_pay, hire_date

# ADDING MULTIPLE ROWS AT ONCE

Instead of adding a single row at one time, we can also add multiple rows at once which is more convenient.

The syntax for inserting multiple rows at once is - 

    INSERT INTO "table_name"
    VALUES 
    ("comma-separated values"), 
    ("comma-separated values"), 
    ("comma-separated values"), 
    ...... ;

So, each set of parenthesis corresponds to a new row.

For example, we can add multiple rows to the "employees" table as - 

    INSERT INTO employees
    VALUES 
    (1, "Eugene", "Krabs", 25.50, "2023-01-02"),
    (2, "Squidward", "Tentacles", 15.00, "2023-01-03"),
    (3, "Spongebob", "Squarepants", 12.50, "2023-01-04"),
    (4, "Patrick", "Star", 12.50, "2023-01-05"),
    (5, "Sandy", "Cheeks", 17.25, "2023-01-06");

The above statement will add five rows to the table.

# ADDING DATA TO SPECIFIC COLUMNS ONLY

By default, when we use "INSERT" statement, we are required to provide data for each column. This means, if we try to do - 


    INSERT INTO employees
    VALUES (1, "Eugene", "Krabs");

Then, we will get an error because there are five columns but we are providing data for only three.

But, sometimes, we do not want to fill the data for every column. In that case, how to only insert data into specific columns for a row?

For that, we have to explcitly specify for what columns are are inserting the data. The syntax is - 

    INSERT INTO "table_name" ("comma-separated column names")
    VALUES ("comma-separated values for the columns mentioned above");

For example - 

    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
    VALUES (6, "Sheldon", "Plankton")

This will add a new row to the "employees" table which has data for only three out of five columns. So, what about the other two columns? Well, in those columns, we will have a value "NULL". "NULL" simply means there is no data for this particular column for this row.
