A CHECK constraint is an integrity constraint that controls the value in a particular column. It ensures that the inserted or updated value in a column must be matched with the given condition.

The syntax for a CHECK constraint when we create a new Table is - 

    CREATE TABLE "table_name" (
        "column_name" "datatype",
        "column_name" datatype",
        .....
        CHECK(condition)
    )

For example, in our "employees" table, we want to add a check such that the value for the hourly_pay column is at least $10.00. So, we can say -

    CREATE TABLE employees (
        "other columns".....
        hourly_pay DECIMAL (5,2),
        "other columns".....
        CHECK(hourly_pay >= 10.00)
    )

A good idea is to give a name to the checks in your table so that later if you want to remove a check or update it, you can easily do that by the name you have given. To give a specific name to a check, we can do -

    CREATE TABLE employees (
        "other columns".....
        hourly_pay DECIMAL (5,2),
        "other columns".....
        CONSTRAINT min_hourly_pay CHECK(hourly_pay >= 10.00)
    )

Here, the name of the CHECK is "min_hourly_pay".

To add a CHECK constraint to an existing table, this would be the syntax - 

    ALTER TABLE "table_name"
    ADD CONSTRAINT "name" CHECK (condition)

For example, for the existing "employees" table, to add a check for "hourly_pay", we can do -

    ALTER TABLE employees
    ADD CONSTRAINT min_hourly_pay CHECK (hourly_pay >= 10.00)

Now, this check means that no row can have the hourly_pay value less than 10.00. 

For example, if we try to update an existing row - 

    UPDATE employees
    SET hourly_pay = 9.00 
    WHERE employee_id = 4;

This query will fail because it violates the check that says the hourly_pay must be at least $10.

Similarly, we cannot add a new row with hourly_pay value less than $10.

# DROPPING A CHECK

If you want to Drop a check from a table, we can make use of the name that we had given to the check.

To drop a check, we do -

    ALTER TABLE "table_name"
    DROP CHECK "check_name"

For example, in the "employees" table, to drop the "min_hourly_pay" check, we can do -

    ALTER TABLE employees
    DROP CHECK min_hourly_pay

And now, since the check no longer exists, this means we can now update any existing row and set an hourly_pay value less than $10. And we can also insert a new row with hourly_pay value less than $10.
