The UNION operator is used to combine the result from two of more SELECT statements. While it sounds pretty straightforward, there are some things that we need to keep in mind when using the UNION operator.

    - Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
    - The columns must also have similar data types
    - The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order

The syntax of the UNION operator is - 

    SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
    UNION
    SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

For example, let's say we have two tables - "income" and "expenses". And in both the tables, we have two columns, one for the name of the income or expense, and the second for the amount spent or amount received.

As per the rules, we can combine the result of SELECT statements on these two tables because both have same number of columns and the columns have same datatypes. So, we can do -

    SELECT * FROM income
    UNION
    SELECT * FROM expenses;

# UNION ALL OPERATOR

By default, when we use "UNION" operator to combine the two SELECT statements, it will only return distinct records. This means, if there are two identical records in the two tables, then only one will show up in the result table.

But, if we want to get all the records, no matter if there are duplicates, we can use the "UNION ALL" operator instead of "UNION" operator.

    SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

It is important to note that the name of the columns in the result table are the same as names of columns in the first "SELECT" statement. 

Suppose we have two tables "employees" and "customers", where the 'employees' table has two columns "emp_first_name" and "emp_last_name".

The "customers" table has two columns "first_name" and "last_name".

Now, if we write - 

    SELECT emp_first_name, emp_last_name FROM employees
    UNION
    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers

Then, the resulting table will have two columns named "emp_first_name" and "emp_last_name" because these are the names of the columns in the first "SELECT" statement.

If we want to give a better name for columns, we can use the "AS" keyword in first "SELECT" statement.
