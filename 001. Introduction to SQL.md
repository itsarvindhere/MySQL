SQL is an acronym for "Structured Query Language".

It is a language that is used to interact with a database to "Create", "Update", "Retrieve" and "Delete" the data.

But why do we require a database?

Imagine we have a business and we have to keep track of all the transactions. The old way is using pen and paper which is, well, not a good way anymore. Imagine having thousands of records maintained on some notebook and then having to update some specific record.

A better way is to maintain the records electronically in a database. 

Now, when it comes to using a database, there are multiple options. But, we can broadly classify different types of databases into two types - 

    1. Relational
    2. Non-Relational

Relational Databases use "Tables" to keep the data. A Table has "Rows" and "Columns". And as the name suggests, multiple tables in a Relational Database can form "relationships". That is done using something called "keys".

Non-Relational Databases use different formats, other than a Table, to manage the data. Non-Relational Databases can include the "Document" databases, "Graph" databases etc.

"SQL" is used to interact with a "Relational" database. "NoSQL" is used to interact with a "Non-Relational" database. "NoSQL" stands for "Not Only SQL".

It is important to understand the difference between SQL and MySQL. "SQL" is a language to interact with a Relational Database. "MySQL" is a "Relational Database Management System" (RDBMS).

You can think of RDBMS as a workspace to write "SQL" statements and work with the database.

Now, "MySQL" is not the only RDBMS that we have. There are many other Database Management Systems we can use such as "Oracle", "Microsoft SQL Server", "PostgreSQL" etc.

You may think that if all these use the same language, then how are they different from each other. Each of these database management systems have their advantages. For example, MySQL is simple and offers good performance, whereas PostgreSQL is known for its advanced features, security and data integrity.

The bottomline is that, if you are familiar with one DBMS, it won't take much effort to transition to some other.
