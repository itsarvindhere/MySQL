The SELECT statement is one of the most commonly used SQL statements which is used to query the data from a table. 

To see all the records in the table, we do -

    SELECT * FROM "table_name"

# FETCHING ONLY SPECIFIC COLUMNS 

But, sometimes, we only need to retrieve certain data from the table. For example, what if, from the employees table, we only need the first_name and last_name of the employees?

For that, we can specify the column names in the SELECT statement. The syntax is - 

    SELECT "comma-separated column names" FROM "table_name";

For example - 

    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;

The order in which you provide the column names matters. In the above statement, since the "first_name" column appears before "last_name" column, the result will have data in the same order.

# FETCHING DATA CONDITIONALLY

Most of the time, we have some condition based on which we want to get the relevant data. For example, we are asked to fetch the first_name and last_name of only those employees which have a hourly pay higher than $15. In that case, we can add this condition using a "WHERE" clause.

The syntax is - 

    SELECT "comma-separated column names" FROM "table_name"
    WHERE "condition"

For example -

    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
    WHERE hourly_pay > 15

# THE COMPARISON OPERATORS

In the above statement, we used the "greater than" comparison operator using the symbol ">". There are other comparison operators in MySQL that we can use.

These are -

        =	Equal to	
        >	Greater than	
        <	Less than	
        >=	Greater than or equal to	
        <=	Less than or equal to	
        <>	Not equal to (!= also works the same way)

# WORKING WITH NULL DATA

Based on abvoe example, what if we want to find the employee data for which hourly_pay is NULL. What about - 

    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
    WHERE hourly_pay = NULL

Well, this query will not work as expected and we will get no data as the output. 

To deal with NULL values, we use the "IS" keyword instead of the "=" operator.

    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
    WHERE hourly_pay IS NULL

The reason why normal operators will not work with 'NULL' is because "NULL" denotes no value. And the comparison operators only work with actual values. 

If we want to to add a condition in the "SELECT" statement to exclude the rows with "NULL" values, we can use "IS NOT" keyword.

    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
    WHERE hourly_pay IS NOT NULL
