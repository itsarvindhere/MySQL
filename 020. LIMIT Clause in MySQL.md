Sometimes, the result set is huge so we want to LIMIT the number of rows we should get in the result set. For that, we can use the 'LIMIT' clause in MySQL.

The syntax is - 

    SELECT * FROM "table_name"
    LIMIT "how many records you want to see in result table"

For example, if we want to get the data of the first 3 employees in the table, we can say -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    LIMIT 3

The LIMIT clause becomes even more useful when combined with the ORDER BY clause. So, we can first Sort the records based on some column and then from that sorted result set, we can get only specific number of records.

For example, we want to get details of the 3 employees who are in the company for the longest period of time. In other words, we want the records to be sorted by hire_date in increasing order.

So, we can write - 

    SELECT * FROM employees
    ORDER BY hire_date
    LIMIT 3

# OFFSET

Sometimes, we want to fetch some specific data from the table. For example, we want to fetch the employees with employee_id in range 3 - 5, both inclusive. That is, we want the 3rd, 4th and 5th employee.

In that case, we can use the LIMIT clause with an OFFSET. The syntax is -

    SELECT * FROM "table_name"
    LIMIT 'how many rows to return' OFFSET 'after which row to start'

For example, if we write - 

    SELECT * FROM employees
    LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2

This query means we want to get "3" rows from the employees table, starting from the row "3". 

OFFSET 2 means start after the row "2" (not including row "2")

The OFFSET is very helpful to distribute the result set among various pages. For example, if we have 100 records and we want each result set to have 10 records at max, we can use OFFSET.

For example, for the first 10 records, we say -

    SELECT * FROM "table_name"
    LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0

Then, for the next 10 records, we say -

    SELECT * FROM "table_name"
    LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10

Then, for next 10 records, we say-

    SELECT * FROM "table_name"
    LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20

And so on.....
