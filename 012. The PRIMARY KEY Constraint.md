To uniquely identify each record in a Table, we use the "PRIMARY KEY" constraint.

When we use "PRIMARY KEY" constraint on any column(s), that column then needs to have UNIQUE values and no value can be NULL. In other words, adding a "PRIMARY KEY" constraint to a column automatically means adding "UNIQUE" and "NOT NULL" constraints to that column as well.

To understand the concept of a "PRIMARY KEY" better, take an example of the "employees" table. Two or more employees can have the same first and last name but the one thing that should be different for both is their employee id. So here, the employee id is the "PRIMARY KEY" of the "employees" table because it can be used to uniquely identify each employee.

While a table can only have "ONE" Primary Key, a Primary Key itself can be comprised of one or more columns.

To understand it better, let's take the example of the employees table again. We can also say that the combination of (employee id, email) is a PRIMARY KEY for the employees table because these two combined can be used to uniquely identify any employee.

# ADDING PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINT TO A NEW TABLE

When we create a new Table, we can add the PRIMARY KEY constraint to a column using the following syntax - 

    CREATE TABLE "table_name" (
        "column_name" "data_type" PRIMARY KEY,
        "column_name" "data_type",
        ......
    );

For example, if we create a new table "transactions" and we want the "transaction_id" column to be the PRIMARY KEY column, we can do -

    CREATE TABLE transactions (
        transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        amount DECIMAL(5,2)
    );

# ADDING PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINT TO AN EXISTING TABLE

If the table already exists and we want to add the PRIMARY KEY constraint to that table, we can use the following syntax -

    ALTER TABLE "table_name"
    MODIFY COLUMN "column_name" "datatype" PRIMARY KEY;

Another way to add PRIMARY KEY constraint to an existing table is -

    ALTER TABLE "table_name"
    ADD CONSTRAINT "custom_name" PRIMARY KEY ("column_name")

# PRIMARY KEY AS COMBINATION OF COLUMNS

We can have a Primary Key in a Table that is the result of combination of values of two or more columns.

For example, suppose that we have a "persons" table with id, first_name, last_name and age columns. We want to have a Primary Key which is a combination of "id" and "last_name" columns. For that, we can do -

    CREATE TABLE Persons (
        ID int NOT NULL,
        LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
        FirstName varchar(255),
        Age int,
        CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,Last_name)
    );

So, we can also provide a custom name for a PRIMARY KEY constraint so that it is easy to update it later if we want to. So, in above query, there is only one PRIMARY KEY named "PK_Person" but its value is the combination of ID and last_name values.

If we want to do the same on an existing table, we can do that by - 

    ALTER TABLE "table_name"
    ADD CONSTRAINT "custom_name" PRIMARY KEY ("column_name", "column_name",.....)

# DROPPING A PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINT

To drop a Primary Key constraint, all we need to do is - 

    ALTER TABLE "table_name"
    DROP PRIMARY KEY;
