The very first thing we do when we start working with a database management system, doesn't matter if it is MySQL or anything else, is to have a "Database".

So, in MySQL, how can we create a Database?

Before that, let's understand what exactly is a "Database".

Think of a "Database" as a folder in which we have different "Tables" as files. So, a "Database" is simply a way to store information that we can then access, transform, update or move with efficiency.

# CREATING A NEW DATABASE IN MYSQL

In MySQL, we can create a new database using the "CREATE" statement. 

    CREATE DATABASE "database-name";

 Note that MySQL is not case sensitive. This means, all the below SQL statements will have the same output as the above statement -

    Create DATABASE "database-name";
    CREATE Database "database-name";
    Create Database "database-name";
    cReAtE dAtABAsE "database-name";

If you are using the "MySQL Workbench" to write your SQL statments, running the above command will show a new database "myDB" created on the left sidebar. 

# USING A DATABASE

Now, we want to tell MySQL that we want to use this newly create database so that whatever we do, we do inside this database only.

For that, there are two ways - Either we manually write a statment in SQL, or we right click the database on left sidebar and then choose "Set as Default Schema".

To do it using SQL, we have to write - 

    USE "database-name";

# DROPPING A DATABASE

Dropping means removing the Database from the DBMS. Again, there are two ways to do this.

We can either right click on the database name on the sidebar of MySQL Workbench and then choose "Drop Schema". Or, we can write the below SQL statement to do so - 

    DROP DATABASE myDB;

# SETTING A DATABASE TO READ-ONLY

Sometimes, we might want to make our database "read-only" which means the data can only be accessed from the database but no modification or insertion of data can be made in the database.

For that, we can use the "ALTER" statement.

So, we can write - 

    ALTER DATABASE "database_name" READ ONLY = 1;

Now, since our database is read only, if we try to make any modifications, that will not be accepted. For example, let's say we now try to "Drop" the database.

    DROP DATABASE "database_name"

This will show an error and the statement will not be successful. That's because the Database is in a "Read-Only" mode.

So, how to disable the "Read-Only" mode?

We will simply execute the same command, but just with one change. Instead of "1", we will use "0" to disable the "Read-Only" mode.

    ALTER DATABASE "database_name" READ ONLY = 0;
