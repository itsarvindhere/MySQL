So, now that we know how we can Create, Alter, and Drop Databases in MySQL, let's understand how can we work with Tables in MySQL.

# CREATING A TABLE IN MYSQL

To create a Table, we again use the "CREATE" statement.

    CREATE TABLE "table_name".....

But, unlike Databases, we also need to provide details of what all "Columns" our table will have and what type of "Data" those columns will have.

If you try to run the above command without specifying at least one column and its data type, then you will get an error saying that a Table must have at least one visible column.

So, how to provide the details of the columns and their data types?

For that, we can do -

    CREATE TABLE "table_name" (
        "column1_name" "datatype"....,
        "column2_name" "datatype"....,
        .....
    )

For example, suppose we have an "employee" table with some fields. Here is how we can create such a table - 

    CREATE TABLE employees (
        employee_id INT,
        first_name VARCHAR(50),
        last_name VARCHAR(50),
        hourly_pay DECIMAL(5,2),
        hire_date DATE
    )

Note that for employee_id, we use a datatype named "INT" which simply means "Integer". 

For first and last name, we used "VARCHAR" which requires us to provide a number which denotes the maximum characters that can be present for this data. This means that first and last names cannot be more than 50 characters long in our employees table.

For hourly_pay, we used the "Decimal" datatype because we know that the salary will have some digits after the decimal. The first argument to "Decimal()" is "5" which means in total, there will be at most "5" digits. The second argument is "2" which means after the decimal, there will be at most "2" digits. In simple words, the maximum value for this column is "999.99".

Finally, we have the "hire_date" column which is of type "Date". That's pretty self-explanatory.

There are many built-in datatypes that MySQL provides. You can read more about them here - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-types.html

# FETCHING DATA FROM A TABLE

So, now that we have our Table created, what if we want to see what this table contains? Ofcourse right now, the table is empty but still, we should be able to see a table-like structure somehow.

For that, we can use the "SELECT" statement in MySQL. We simply write - 

    SELECT * FROM "table_name";

Note that here, "*" means to fetch every single column from the table. This also means that if you want, you can specify what columns you want to fetch.

For example, if, from the "employees" table, we just want the "first_name" and "last_name" columns, we can say -

    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;

The order here matters because the data will be fetched in the same order. That is, the "first_name" column will be shown first and then the "last_name" column.

# RENAMING A TABLE

To rename a table, we can use the "RENAME" statement. 

    RENAME TABLE "current_name" TO "new_name"

For example, if we want to change the name of the table "employees" to "workers", we can say -

    RENAME TABLE employees TO workers

# DROPPING A TABLE

Just like databases, we use the "DROP" statement to Drop a table in MySQL. 

    DROP TABLE "table_name"

This will remove all the data from the table and remove the table itself from the database.

# ADDING A NEW COLUMN

What if we want to add a new "Column" to a Table? We can use the "ALTER" command to do so. 

Let's say we want to add a new column "phone_number" to the employees table. For that, we can say -

    ALTER TABLE employees
    ADD phone_number VARCHAR(15)

We can also use "ADD COLUMN" instead of "ADD" and that will work the same. "ADD COLUMN" is preferred as it is more clear.

    ALTER TABLE employees
    ADD COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(15)

So, just like how we did when we created a new table, we have to provide the Data Type of the column along with the column name.

# ADDING A COLUMN AT A SPECIFIC POSITION

By default, MySQL will add the new column at the end of the Table. But, what if we want to add a new Column at the beginning? That is, it should be the first column of the Table?

For that, we can use the "FIRST" keyword at the end of "ADD COLUMN" statement.

    ALTER TABLE employees
    ADD COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(15) FIRST

If we want to add a column "after" some existing column, we can use the "AFTER" keyword and specify the name of the column after which we want to have that new column.

    ALTER TABLE employees
    ADD COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(15) AFTER last_name

# RENAMING THE COLUMN

Let's say we want to rename the column in our table. Again, we have to use the "ALTER" statement, followed by whatever we want to do with the columns.

So, we will say - 

    ALTER TABLE employees
    RENAME COLUMN phone_number TO phone

Now, the column that was previously named "phone_number" will now be named just "phone".

# MOVING AN EXISTING COLUMN TO A DIFFERENT POSITION

To move a column that already exists in a Table to some other position, we can use "MODIFY COLUMN" statement.

    ALTER TABLE employees
    MODIFY COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(15) AFTER last_name

Note that when we use "MODIFY COLUMN", even though the column is already present, we still are required to provide the datatype otherwise the statement will not work. So, in the above statement, we will place the "phone_number" column after the "last_name" column.

Similarly, if we want this column to be placed at the first position, we can say - 

    ALTER TABLE employees
    MODIFY COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(15) FIRST

# REMOVING A COLUMN

To Remove a column, we can use "DROP" along with the "ALTER TABLE" statement -

    ALTER TABLE employees
    DROP phone_number

Note that instead of "DROP" we can also write "DROP COLUMN". 
    
    ALTER TABLE employees
    DROP COLUMN phone_number

The keyword "COLUMN" is optional but it is considered a good practice to use "DROP COLUMN" as it is more clear what we are doing with this statement.
