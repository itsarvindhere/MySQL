In MySQL, there are various LOGICAL OPERATORS that we can use. Some of the most common ones are "AND", "OR", "NOT", "BETWEEN", "LIKE" and "IN".

We use them with the "WHERE" clause to filter the records based on one or more conditions.

# AND OPERATOR

When we use "AND" operator, the conditions on both sides need to be True for the records that are returned. If for any row, one condition is true and other is false, then that row won't be a valid row for the result.

The syntax is - 

    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

Let's consider an example of "employees" table. Suppose that we have a column named "job" and another column named "hire_date".

We want to filter the records by the employees that have a job of "cook" and they were hired before or on January 5th, 2023.

In that case, we have to write - 

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE job = "cook" AND hire_date <= "2023-01-05"

# OR OPERATOR

The OR operator is also used to combine different conditions together but unlike AND operator, it just requires at least one condition to be True. It does not matter if all other conditions are False.

The syntax is -

    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

For example, if in the employees table, we want to filter the records for employees that are "cooks" or "cashiers", then we can use the "OR" operator.

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE job = "cook" OR job = "cashier"

# NOT OPERATOR

The "NOT" operator is used to "negate" a condition.

The syntax is - 

    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE NOT condition;

For example, we want to see all the employees that are not "cooks".

So, we can do -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE NOT job = 'cook'

# BETWEEN OPERATOR

The BETWEEN operator is used on a single column and it is simply used to filter values for that column.

For example, if we want to filter the records such that the hire_date is between January 1, 2023 to January 5, 2023, we can do -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-05'

The BETWEEN operator is "inclusive" which means the "start" and "end" values are included.

It is also worth mentioning that we can do the same thing with an "AND" operator - 
    
    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE hire_date >= '2023-01-01' AND hire_date <='2023-01-05'

The only thing is that BETWEEN is more readable and cleaner.

# IN OPERATOR .

The 'IN' operator lets you specify multiple values to be checked. If the row matches any ones of the values, then it is considerd in a result set.

The syntax is -

    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);

For example, if we want to check for employees that are either "manangers", "cooks" or "janitors", then, instead of writing three separate conditions and separating them with an "OR" keyword, we can instead write - 

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE job IN ('manager', 'cook', 'janitor')

Another common way os using "IN" is by having another "SELECT" statement whuch will give the values to check against.

For example, if we want to exclude the "asst. manager" job, we can do -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE job IN (SELECT job FROM employees WHERE NOT job = 'asst. manager')

A better way to do the same thing is to use "NOT IN" -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE job NOT IN ('asst. manager')
