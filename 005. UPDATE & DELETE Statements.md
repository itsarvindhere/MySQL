The SELECT statement is used to query data from the table and that's it. We cannot use this statement for anything else such as UPDATING or DELETING data from the table.

To Update or Delete the data, we have other statements.

# UPDATING A ROW IN A TABLE

To update data in a table, we use the "UPDATE" statement. The syntax is - 

    UPDATE "table_name"
    SET "column1_name" = "value1", 
        "column2_name" = "value2",
        ......
    WHERE "condition"

For example, if in the "employee" table, we want to update the hourly_pay and the hire_date of the employee with the id 6, we can do -

    UPDATE employees
    SET hourly_pay = 10.50, 
        hire_date = "2023-01-07"
    WHERE employee_id = 6;

Similarly, if we want to NULLIFY any value, we can set the value as "NULL" for that particular column.

    UPDATE employees
    SET hourly_pay = NULL, 
        hire_date = NULL
    WHERE employee_id = 6;

It is very important to have a "WHERE" clause in the UPDATE statement whenever possible because if there is no "WHERE" clause, the UPDATE will be made to every single row.

# DELETING A ROW FROM A TABLE

To Delete a row from a table we have the "DELETE" statement in SQL. The syntax is - 

    DELETE FROM "table_name"
    WHERE "condition"

For example, if we want to remove the row for the employee with employee_id 6, we can do -

    DELETE FROM employees
    WHERE employee_id = 6

Just like the UPDATE statement, it is very important to keep in mind that you don't forget to write the "WHERE" clause with the "DELETE" statement. Otherwise, it will delete all the rows in the table.
