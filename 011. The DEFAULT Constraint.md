As the name suggests, the "DEFAULT" constraint is used to set a default value for a column if we don't explicitly provide a value.

For example, let's say that in the products table, we want to add some products that are free. This means, their price is $0.00.

If we explicitly have to write the price, we will do -

    INSERT INTO products
    VALUES 
    (104, "straw", 0.00),
    (105, "napkin", 0.00),
    (106, "fork", 0.00),
    (107, "spoon", 0.00);

But, since we know that if we don't mention a price, the price should be 0.00, we can set a default value for the price column.

# ADDING A DEFAULT CONSTRAINT FOR A NEW TABLE

We can add a DEFAULT constraint to a new table using the following syntax -

    CREATE TABLE "table_name" (
        "column_name" "datatype",
        "column_name" datatype" DEFAULT "default value",
        .................
    )

For example, for the "products" table, we can do -

    CREATE TABLE products (
        product_id INT,
        product_name VARCHAR(25),
        price DECIMAL(4,2) DEFAULT 0
    )

# ADDING A DEFAULT CONSTRAINT TO AN EXISTING TABLE

To add a DEFAULT constraint to an existing table, we do -

    ALTER TABLE "table_name"
    MODIFY COLUMN "column" "datatype" DEFAULT "default value";

OR, there is another way to do the same thing. We can do -

    ALTER TABLE "table_name"
    ALTER "column_name" SET DEFAULT "default_value";

For example, if, in the "products" table, we want to add a DEFAULT constraint to the "price" column, we can do -

    ALTER TABLE products
    MODIFY COLUMN price DECIMAL(4,2) DEFAULT 0

Now, when we write the following query -

    INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name)
    VALUES 
    (104, "straw"),
    (105, "napkin"),
    (106, "fork"),
    (107, "spoon");

This will add four new rows to the "products" table and even though we have only provided values for the two columns, the value for the "price" column will be 0.00 for all the four rows because that is the default value that we have set in case the value is not provided for the "price" column.

Another good use case to understand the "DEFAULT" constraint is if we want to have the current timestamp or date or time for each row that we add to a table. We want that value to be populated automatically instead of us having to specify it for every new row.

For example, if we have a table for "transactions" and we want that for each transaction, we automatically have the timestamp value, we can use the DEFAULT constraint. So, when we create the "transactions" table, we can do -

    CREATE TABLE transactions (
        transaction_id INT,
        amount DECIMAL(5,2),
        transaction_date DATETIME DEFAULT NOW()
    );

So, for the "transaction_date" column, the default value will be the current datetime.

Now, when we insert some data, the transaction_date column will be populated automatically.


    INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, amount)
    VALUES 
    (1, 4.99),
    (2, 12.99),
    (3, 9.99);

That's how the DEFAULT constraint works.
