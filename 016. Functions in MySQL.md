In MySQL, there are a ton of built-in functions that we can use to our advantage. The built-in functions help us avoid having to write the logic outselves for common tasks such as "Addition", "Average", "Length", "Lowercase", "Uppercase" and so on.

Just like in programming languages, functions in MySQL can accept parameters and then produce some output.

If you go to the official documentation on the built-in functions, you will find a ton of functions - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/built-in-function-reference.html

Let's take some examples of built-in functions.

# COUNT

If we want to count the number of records in a table, we can use the "COUNT" function. This function becomes even more useful when we pair it with WHERE clause.

For example, if we have a "transactions" table and we want to count how many transactions took place today, we can simply use the COUNT function for that. So, we can do -

    SELECT COUNT(transaction_id) FROM transactions
    WHERE transaction_date = CURRENT_DATE();

In the above query, we used two different built-in functions. We used "COUNT()" to count the number of records and then we also used "CURRENT_DATE()" to get today's date.

One thing to note is that when the above query runs, it will show a result table that has a column named "COUNT(transaction_id)". To give a more sensible name to this column, we can use the "AS" clause.

    SELECT COUNT(transaction_id) as number_of_transactions 
    FROM transactions
    WHERE transaction_date = CURRENT_DATE();

Now, the result table will have the column named "number_of_transactions".

# SUM

Another built-in function is "SUM" which, as the name suggests, lets us get the total of all the values in a column.

    SELECT SUM(amount) as total
    FROM transactions

Now, it is worth noting that if you pass a column_name to the SUM function that is not a number, for example, "first_name", the query will not show any error. Instead, we will get the SUM as simply 0.

# CONCAT

Another pretty useful built-in function is the "CONCAT" function which lets you join two or more string values together into one.

    SELECT CONCAT("comma-separated column_names or strings") as "custom_name"
    FROM 'table_name'

For example, we have a "first_name" and "last_name" column in the "customers" table. Now, we want to join them both to get the full name of the customer and then show it in the result table. 

For this, we can use the "CONCAT" function.

    SELECT CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name) as full_name
    FROM customers
