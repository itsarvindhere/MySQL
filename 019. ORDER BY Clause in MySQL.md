If we want to Sort our result set based on some table, then we use the "ORDER BY" clause. 

The syntax is - 

    SELECT column1, column2 ..... FROM "table_name"
    ORDER BY column1, column2.... ASC | DESC

By default, the "ORDER BY" clause sorts the result set in Ascending / Increasing order. 

To sort the result set in descending order, we have to explicitly use "DESC" at the end of ORDER BY statement.

For example, let's say we want to list all the rows in our "employees" table but we want the employees table to be sorted by the first_name in ASCENDING ORDER. So, we can write - 

    SELECT * FROM employees
    ORDER BY first_name

Similarly, if we want to list all the rows based on the first_name in DESCENDING ORDER, we will say -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    ORDER BY first_name DESC

# ORDER BY MULTIPLE COLUMNS

Sometimes, we want to also have a tie-breaker in case two rows have the same value for the column based on which we are ordering.

For example, let's say that we want to order the employees by their "job" in ASCENDING order. But, if two employees have the same job, then their records should then be ordered based on their first_name in ASCENDING ORDER. In that case, we will say -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    ORDER BY job,first_name

Now, let's take this one step further. We want to sort the records based on the "job" in DESCENDING ORDER but if two employees have the same job, we want the records to be orderd by the first_name in ASCENDING order. So, we can say -

    SELECT * FROM employees
    ORDER BY job DESC, first_name ASC

Since by default the order is Ascending, there is no need to explicitly mention "ASC". We can also write - 

    SELECT * FROM employees
    ORDER BY job DESC, first_name
