By default, any column in MySQL can have NULL values in it. And we have seen that already when we discussed adding a new row with values only for some of the columns. 

But, sometimes, we want to make sure a specific column does not have a "NULL" value. In other words, it should have some value.

For example, the first and last name columns should not be empty for any row. And we can explicitly enforce this rule by using the "NOT NULL" constraint.

If we are creating a new table, we can add the "NOT NULL" constraint at that time as - 

    CREATE TABLE "table_name" (
        "column_name" "datatype" NOT NULL,
        "column_name" "datatype" NOT NULL,
        .....
    )

In one table, multiple columns can have the NOT NULL constraint.

Now, if you want to add the "NOT NULL" constraint to an existing column in a table, we can use the "MODIFY COLUMN" statement alongside the "ALTER TABLE" statement.

    ALTER TABLE "table_name"
    MODIFY COLUMN "column_name" "datatype" NOT NULL

It is important to note that if the column that you are trying to add "NOT NULL" constraint to has at least one NULL data, then you will get an error. You need to make sure that there is no NULL value already in a column before trying to add NOT NULL constraint to it.

Once the NOT NULL constraint is added, we cannot update a column to set a NULL value. For example, the below query will fail -

    UPDATE products
    SET product_name = NULL
    WHERE product_id = 101;

Also, this means that when we insert a new row, then it is mandatory to provide a value for the "product_name" column because it cannot have NULL values.
