The "AUTO_INCREMENT" keyword can be used in MySQL to perform an auto-increment of values for a column. Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.

Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.

By Default, the starting value for the "AUTO_INCREMENT" is "1" and for every new record, this value is incremented by 1.

# AUTO_INCREMENT CAN ONLY BE ADDED TO A COLUMN DEFINED AS A "KEY"

It is very important to note that in MySQL, we cannot use "AUTO_INCREMENT" keyword on any column. This keyword can only be used on columns that are defined as "KEYS". For example, a PRIMARY KEY.

# ADDING "AUTO_INCREMENT" TO A NEW TABLE

To add the "AUTO_INCREMENT" keyword in a new table, we can use the following syntax - 

    CREATE TABLE "table_name" (
        "column_name" "datatype" AUTO_INCREMENT,
        .....
    )

Let's say we create a new table "transactions" with "transaction_id" and "amount" columns. If we try to do this - 

    CREATE TABLE transactions (
        transaction_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
        amount DECIMAL(5,2)
    );

This will not work. The reason is that we cannot apply "AUTO_INCREMENT" to a column that is not a key.

So, we can add the PRIMARY KEY constraint to the transaction_id column and then it will work as expected.


    CREATE TABLE transactions (
        transaction_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        amount DECIMAL(5,2)
    );

And now, the above query will work properly.

Now, if we add a new row without specifying a transaction_id -

    INSERT INTO transactions (amount)
    VALUES (3.99)

Now, even if we did not provide transaction_id, the row will still have a default value for the transaction_id as "1" since this is the first row we are entering in this table.

But, one thing to note is that, lets say that we enter a new ROW in the table and we explicitly provide a transaction_id as '100'. Currently, the AUTO_INCREMENT value is at "1" and since 1 < 100, whatever new row we will now insert, that will not get the transaction_id as "2". Instead, it will get a transaction_id as "101".

So, you can think of this in this way -> The AUTO_INCREMENT will always look at the largest value so far in the column and then add "1" to that value for every new row.

# CUSTOM STARTING VALUE FOR AUTO_INCREMENT

By default, AUTO_INCREMENT starts from "1". But, we can manually specify a custom starting value. 

Let's say we want to have a transactions table where the values for transcation_id should start from 1000.

So, after creating the table, we can do -

    ALTER TABLE "table_name"
    AUTO_INCREMENT = "custom_value";

For example - 

    ALTER TABLE transactions
    AUTO_INCREMENT = 1000;

Note that this will not have any effect on the rows that already exist in the table. This will only affect the rows that will be inserted after the above query has run successfully.
